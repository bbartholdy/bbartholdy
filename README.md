### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Steward at TU Delft, and in my spare time I'm a PhD student in Archaeology (ish), where I employ methods from oral microbiology (poorly). I enjoy using R (like a nerd) for analyses, manuscripts, and useless packages that no one will use ğŸ¤·

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing an oral biofilm model to grow dental calculus
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning bayesian statistics
- ğŸ’¬ You can ask me about my dissertation, or see the progress [here](https://myphd.netlify.app)
