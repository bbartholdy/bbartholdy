### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in Archaeology (ish), employing methods from oral microbiology (poorly), who enjoys using R (like a nerd) for analyses, manuscripts, and useless packages that no one will use ðŸ¤·

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing an oral biofilm model to grow dental calculus
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning bayesian statistics
